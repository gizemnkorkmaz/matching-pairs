# Matching Pairs Game

This project is a mobile-friendly matching pairs game played with a set of cards. You challenge your memory by matching all the pairs of the images you flipped. You can choose different difficulty levels which contain a different number of cards, collect scores based on your total turns count, and reset your best score to start over.
